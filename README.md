This project is a structured HTML5 webpage created as part of CSC 4035 Lab 2. It includes semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and 
<footer> to organize content, along with a contact form that uses HTML5 validation for name, email, and message fields. The webpage was validated using the 
W3C Validator to ensure compliance with web standards, and the project has been published on GitHub for version control and submission.
