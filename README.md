This project is a structured HTML5 webpage created for CSC 4035 Lab 2. It uses semantic HTML5 elements to organize content effectively, including header, navigation, main section, article, and footer. The page also features a contact form that includes HTML5 validation for name, email, and message fields. The webpage was validated using the W3C Validator to ensure it meets web standards, and the project has been published on GitHub for version control and submission.
